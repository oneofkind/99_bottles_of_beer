# The beersong

## introduce
用 JS 开发一个简单的歌词生成器,用以生成`beersong`

`The beersong`的歌词符合以下规律

    X bottles of beer on the wall, X bottles of beer.
    Take one down and pass it around, X-1 bottles of beer on the wall.
    X-1 bottles of beer on the wall, X bottles of beer.
    ...

歌词的最后两段内容有所不同，大致如下
    
    1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
    Take one down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.
    No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.
    Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.
    
现在，需要你自己写一个程序生成这份歌词。并且通过测试
